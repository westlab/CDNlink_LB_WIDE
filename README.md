# cdnlink_lb_wide

CDNlink Load Balancing on WIDE network backbone topology is a network simulator for load balancing simulation on CDN.
The simulator is running on MatLab Simulink ver 2015a and 2014a. The simulation is tested on Win7 with i7 proc and 16GB ram.

The proposing algorithm in this simulation is a smart dynamic load balancing using feature from Service-oriented Router (SoR) which can intercept the traffic and collect the content elapsed time (CET) from stream of packet.
